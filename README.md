Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a homo-sapien of the male type from the South-West UK. I'm trying to learn how to code in Python - I'm using PyCharm and SoloLearn. I also like other things. I have a somewhat large steam libary and I play a lot of Minecraft. I am an administrator on the Pedestria server, so I work with theopcoder/Mike/THEMLGDUDE (https://github.com/theopcoder) regularly. I also have several hobbies, too many to list here!

Once I have learnt Python, I may be available to hire. For now though, I can barely code anything
